# DBTagEditor

Needed a quick way to view images and edit the caption text files of small LoRA image databases.

This file opens up two windows, an image preview and a text box. The image window is resizable, and the image will fit to space.
PgUP/PgDn opens the next/prev image. Text is not saved automatically, the save button must be pressed.
